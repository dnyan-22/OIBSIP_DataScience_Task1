# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task1
# Iris Flower Classification

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The classification is done using Machine Learning based on flower measurements.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample belongs to one of the three iris species.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn  
2. Separated features and target labels  
3. Split the dataset into training and testing data  
4. Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier  
5. Tested the model on unseen data  
6. Evaluated performance using accuracy score  

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
2. Run all cells from top to bottom  
3. View model predictions and accuracy in the output  

---

## 📈 Outcome
The model successfully classifies iris flowers with an accuracy of approximately **95–100%**, depending on the data split.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project helped in understanding the basics of Machine Learning, classification problems, and model evaluation using Scikit-learn.
